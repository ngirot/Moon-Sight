                    Welcome to Moon Sight, your interactive portal for exploring the moon as it appears in the sky from
                    any location on Earth, at any date and time. Whether you&apos;re a casual observer or an avid astronomer,
                    Moon Sight provides a real-time visualization of the moon&apos;s phase, position, and visibility,
                    customized
                    for your specific location and time zone. You can also look back to see the moon&apos;s past phases or
                    forward
                    to see how it will appear in the future.

                <Typography variant="body1" mt={2}>
                    However, please note that our system does not manage horizon
                    effects yet, meaning the tool does not account for the moon&apos;s rise or set times, nor whether the
                    moon is
                    visible above the local horizon at a given time. Moon Sight will show you the moon&apos;s position as if
                    viewed from the celestial sphere, even if it is technically below the horizon in your area.
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" mt={2}>
                    Additionally, lunar eclipses are not managed by our system, so the moonâ€™s appearance during
                    these events will not be reflected accurately.
                </Typography>
                <Typography variant="body1" mt={2} mb={3}>
                    Moon Sight is perfect for everyone from casual stargazers to seasoned astronomers, offering a
                    stunning
                    and accurate view of the moon&apos;s journey across the sky. Discover the beauty of the moon from any
                    point on Earth, and explore its phases and movements throughout time. ðŸŒ™
